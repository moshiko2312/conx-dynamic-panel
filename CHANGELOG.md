# Changelog

All notable changes to this private project will be documented here.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Home Assistant custom integration `conx_dynamic_panel` with Config Flow, Reconfigure Flow, and Options Flow.
- Zemismart 4-gang adapter using Home Assistant `switch`, `text`, and `select` entities.
- Versioned profile storage with draft vs applied snapshot model.
- Toggle, radio mandatory, and radio optional profile engine.
- Transition suppression for integration-generated relay changes.
- Sync state machine with confirmation waits, overall sync timeout, and failed-sync snapshot preservation.
- Out-of-sync detection when a hardware pull differs from the applied snapshot.
- Integration entities: active profile select, sync status/last sync/last error sensors, sync/pull buttons, auto-sync switch.
- Services: sync, activate_profile, pull_from_panel, execute_button, reload.
- Authenticated WebSocket CRUD API for the custom card.
- Bundled Lit/TypeScript Lovelace card with English and Hebrew RTL UI.
- Private install/update/build scripts without HACS.
- Backend and frontend automated tests plus private CI workflow.
- Best-effort automatic Lovelace resource registration; manual resource step remains documented.
- Options wiring for confirmation timeout, sync timeout, auto-sync, and log level.
- Installation and troubleshooting documentation for private deployment.

### Fixed

- Reconfigure flow now updates the existing config entry instead of creating a new one.
- Summary step requires explicit confirmation after successful mapping validation.
- Mapping validation rejects unavailable/disabled text entities and select entities without options.
- Storage load failures preserve on-disk data and surface an in-memory error message.
- Pull-from-panel correctly sets `out_of_sync` when hardware differs from the applied snapshot.

### Changed

- Manifest `iot_class` set to `local_push` to reflect entity state listeners rather than a poll loop.

### Excluded by design

- HACS support.
- Public marketplace distribution.
- Open-source licensing.
- Direct MQTT implementation in the MVP.

## [Unreleased]

### Notes

- Post-0.1.0 work tracked in the README roadmap (mixed mode, import/export, additional adapters, and related items).
